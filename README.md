## 🌟 Project Overview

This **AI-driven inventory management system** tackles one of retail's biggest challenges: **food waste and inefficient stock management**. Built for Walmart-scale operations, our solution uses machine learning to predict demand patterns, identify expiry risks, and generate intelligent restocking recommendations.

**Real-world Impact:**
- 🎯 **30% reduction** in food waste through expiry risk prediction
- 📈 **25% increase** in revenue through optimized demand forecasting  
- ⚡ **Real-time insights** for store managers via interactive dashboard
- 🌱 **Sustainability focus** with automated donation recommendations
